## These are four projects that I have worked on in 2024 fall

### Module 1: Yeast and Cicada population dynamics
### Module 2: Snowshoe hares and the Canadian Lynx population dynamics(prey-predator relationship)
### Module 3: SIR model for COVID-19
### Module 4: Malaria transmission model (Vector-borne disease)

#### These projects are designed around the computational implementation of mathematical models and use of that implementation to explore the properties of the model. The projects are treated as a computational experiments and the results are written in the style of a laboratory report.
