## These are four projects that I had worked on in 2024 fall

#### Module 1-2: Computational Modeling of population dynamics
### Module 1: Yeast and Cicada population dynamics
### Module 2: Snowshoe hares and the Canadian Lynx population dynamics (prey-predator relationship)

##
#### Module 3-4: Computational Modeling of epidemiology
### Module 3: SIR model for COVID-19
### Module 4: Malaria transmission model (Vector-borne disease)

#### These projects were designed around the computational implementation of mathematical models by using MATLAB and use of that implementation to explore the properties of the model. The projects were treated as a computational experiments and the results were written in the style of a laboratory report.
