#Yeast and Cicada population dynamics

This directory contains MATLAB code for simulating Yeast and Cicada population dynamics and their lab reports. 

Purpose: Running 

As a continuously growing species, we modeled the growth of yeast with an unrestricted (exponential) growth model:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12366801-451a-4804-9b06-6c0f7e842922) or with the logistic equation:

As a species with a clearly periodic growth cycle in which reporduction occurs in synchronized bursts, we modeled the growth of Cicada with a discrete time growth model such as that of Hassell:
