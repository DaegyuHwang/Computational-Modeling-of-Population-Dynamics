### #Snowshoe hares and the Canacian Lynx population dynamics

This directory contains MATLAB code and the corresponding lab report that simultaneously simulates the dynamics of hare and lynx populations.

Purpose: Running mathematical models for the population dynamics of hares and Lynx considering their pre-predator relationship to explain their growth in the real-world and discuss the implications of the the results.


### #Used Mathematical model 

We built a simplest mathematical model and continued to add factors to account for the phenomenon in the real-world conditions.

Since the populaions of both species show a cyclic prey-predator interactions, we started from the basic Lotka-Volterra model:

We proposed a more realistic model, the Hollings disk equation, that describes intraspecific competition between prey (using the logistic equation) and a saturated predator response function:
