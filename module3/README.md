#Snowshoe hares and the Canacian Lynx population dynamics

This directory contains MATLAB code and the corresponding lab report that simultaneously simulates the dynamics of hare and lynx populations.

Purpose: Running mathematical models for the population dynamics of hares and Lynx considering their pre-predator relationship to explain their growth in the real-world and discuss the implications of the the results.
