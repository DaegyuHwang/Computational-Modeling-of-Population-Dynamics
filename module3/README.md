#SIR model for COVID-19

This directory contains MATLAB code and the corresponding lab report that simulates and predicts the infectious population for the disease.

Purpose: Running mathematical models for the population dynamics of a disease, considering properties of the disease, to predict their growth of the disease in the real world and discuss the implications of the the results.

#Used Mathematical model

We introduced SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) model to predict the effect of COVID-19, considering its property that individuals generally develop some degree of immunity after an infection (although the immunity may wane over time) or through vaccination. A basic SIR model is schematically described by:

We can make a discrete equation model:
